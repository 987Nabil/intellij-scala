<!--
Inspired by default ivy settings located in `ivy-2.5.0.jar!/org/apache/ivy/core/settings/ivysettings.xml`

Patched to only use file system resolves.
Resolvers which resolve in repositories (via Internet) are meant to be configured in code in DependencyManager.
The settings should make Ivy to use only file system repositories and caches.
