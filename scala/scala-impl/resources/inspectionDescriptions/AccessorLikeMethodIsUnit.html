<p>Reports methods with accessor-like names that have result type <code>Unit</code>.</p>
<p>Methods that follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBean">JavaBean</a> naming contract for accessors are
    expected to have no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side effects</a>. However,
    methods with a result type of <code>Unit</code> are only executed for their side effects.</p>
<p>This indicates that the method should either result in a non-<code>Unit</code> type or
    be renamed to better reflect the side effect.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  trait Test {
    def getTarget(): Unit
  }
</code></pre>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>This inspection will not report methods that override other members.</p>
