Reports '=' missing between result type and function body.
<p>A type cannot be refined when used as the result type of a function.
    When a '=' is missing between result type and function body it might look like it, however.</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  def test(): T {}
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied</p>
<pre><code>
  def test(): T = {}
</code></pre>
