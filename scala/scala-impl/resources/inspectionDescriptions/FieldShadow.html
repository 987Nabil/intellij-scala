    <title>Warn when one field name suspiciously shadow another</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The most common case of this is when you declare a field in the class, and then in a method use a local value
    or variable of the same name:</p>
<pre><code>
    class Foo(foo: Int) {
      def test(): Int = {
        val foo: Int = 1 // highlighted
        foo
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is easy to catch but it gets more tricky if the field is declared in a superclass or trait in another file -
    then the field might be less visible and it is easier to make an error:</p>

<pre><code>
    // TraitA.scala
    trait TraitA {
      def n: Int = 1
    }

    // ObjectA.scala
    object ObjectA extends TraitA {
      def foo(): Unit = {
        val n: Int = 0 // highlighted
      }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>There is a special case when the superclass defines a variable, and the subclass defines a value of the same name.
   If they were both values, the subclass value would override the superclass one. But since the one in the superclass
   is a variable, the value can't override it and only shadows it instead. That sometimes leads to difficult to spot
   errors. The Scala compiler accepts the option `-Xlint:private-shadow` which issues a warning in such situations.
   This inspection can also be used to highlight it - either in every case, or only when the compiler option is on.</p>

<pre><code>
    class C(var c: Int)

    class D(c: Int) extends C(c) {
      // `c` shadows `var c` from the `C` class
      def f: Int = c
    }
</code></pre>
