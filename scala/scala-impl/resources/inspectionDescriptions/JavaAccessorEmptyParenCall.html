Reports calls to Java accessor methods with empty argument clauses.

<p>Methods that follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBean">JavaBean</a> naming contract for accessors are
    expected to have no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)">side effects</a>.
    The recommended convention is to use a parameterless method whenever there are
    no parameters and the method have no side effect.
    This convention promotes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_access_principle">uniform access principle</a>,
    which says that the client code should not be affected by the decision to implement an attribute as a field or method.</p>

<p>The problem is that Java does not implement the uniform access principle.
    To bridge that gap, Scala allows you to leave off the empty parentheses
    on an invocation of a Java method that takes no arguments.</p>

<p>The quick-fix removes the empty argument clause.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  "test".getClass()
</code></pre>
<p>After the quick-fix is applied:</p>
<pre><code>
  "test".getClass
</code></pre>
