    <title>Suspicious shadowing of a superclass field by a private field or class parameter</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is about a corner case in extending a class where the user might suspect the value in the subclass overrides
    the one from the superclass, but in fact it is only shadowed. That sometimes leads to non-trivial errors.
    The Scala compiler takes the option <code>-Xlint:private-shadow</code> which issues a warning in such case.</p>
<p> The checkbox allows for controlling how to highlight this corner case. You can leave it unchecked to <b>always</b>
    highlight the suspicious shadowing, or you can check it to <b>comply with the compiler option</b> and
    let the inspection behave accordingly.</p>

<pre><code>
class C(var c: Int)

// `c` shadows `var c` from the `C` class
class D(c: Int) extends C(c) {
  def f: Int = c
}
</code></pre>
